MISC,"` ` Bayes mixture "" , ` ` Solomonoff induction "" , ` ` marginalization "" , all these terms refer to a central induction principle : Obtain a predictive distribution by integrating the product of prior and evidence over the model class"
CONT,"In many cases however , the Bayes mixture is computationally infeasible , and even a sophisticated approximation is expensive"
MISC,The MDL or MAP ( maximum a posteriori ) estimator is both a common approximation for the Bayes mixture and interesting for its own sake : Use the model with the largest product of prior and evidence
MISC,"In practice , the MDL estimator is usually being approximated too , since only a local maximum is determined"
MISC,How good are the predictions by Bayes mixtures and MDL
MISC,This question has attracted much attention
MISC,"In many cases , an important quality measure is the   total   or cumulative   expected loss   of a predictor"
MISC,In particular the square loss is often considered
MISC,"Assume that the outcome space is finite , and the model class is continuously parameterized"
MISC,"Then for Bayes mixture prediction , the cumulative expected square loss is usually small but unbounded , growing with   SYMBOL , where   SYMBOL   is the sample size   CITATION"
MISC,This corresponds to an   instantaneous   loss bound of   SYMBOL
MISC,"For the MDL predictor , the losses behave similarly   CITATION   under appropriate conditions , in particular with a specific prior"
MISC,"Note that in order to do MDL for continuous model classes , one needs to   discretize   the parameter space , see also   CITATION"
MISC,"On the other hand , if the model class is discrete , then Solomonoff 's theorem   CITATION   bounds the cumulative expected square loss for the Bayes mixture predictions finitely , namely by   SYMBOL , where   SYMBOL   is the prior weight of the ` ` true "" model   SYMBOL"
MISC,"The only necessary assumption is that the true distribution   SYMBOL   is contained in the model class , ie that we are dealing with   proper learning"
MISC,"It has been demonstrated   CITATION , that for both Bayes mixture and MDL , the proper learning assumption can be essential : If it is violated , then learning may fail very badly"
MISC,"For MDL predictions in the proper learning case , it has been shown   CITATION   that a bound of   SYMBOL   holds"
MISC,"This bound is exponentially larger than the Solomonoff bound , and it is sharp in general"
MISC,A finite bound on the total expected square loss is particularly interesting :    It implies convergence of the predictive to the true probabilities with probability one
MISC,"In contrast , an instantaneous loss bound of   SYMBOL   implies only convergence in probability"
MISC,"Additionally , it gives a   convergence speed , in the sense that errors of a certain magnitude can not occur too often"
MISC,"So for both , Bayes mixtures and MDL , convergence with probability one holds , while the convergence speed is exponentially worse for MDL compared to the Bayes mixture"
MISC,"We avoid the term ` ` convergence rate "" here , since the order of convergence is identical in both cases"
MISC,"It is eg   SYMBOL   if we additionally assume that the error is monotonically decreasing , which is not necessarily true in general )"
MISC,It is therefore natural to ask if there are model classes where the cumulative loss of MDL is comparable to that of Bayes mixture predictions
AIMX,"In the present work , we concentrate on the simplest possible stochastic case , namely discrete Bernoulli classes"
OWNX,"Note that then the MDL ` ` predictor "" just becomes an estimator , in that it estimates the true parameter and directly uses that for prediction"
OWNX,"Nevertheless , for consistency of terminology , we keep the term predictor"
MISC,It might be surprising to discover that in general the cumulative loss is still exponential
OWNX,"On the other hand , we will give mild conditions on the prior guaranteeing a small bound"
MISC,"Moreover , it is well - known that the instantaneous square loss of the Maximum Likelihood estimator decays as   SYMBOL   in the Bernoulli case"
MISC,"The same holds for MDL , as we will see"
MISC,"If convergence speed is measured in terms of instantaneous losses , then much more general statements are possible   CITATION , this is briefly discussed in Section"
MISC,A particular motivation to consider discrete model classes arises in Algorithmic Information Theory
MISC,"From a computational point of view , the largest relevant model class is the class of all computable models on some fixed universal Turing machine , precisely prefix machine   CITATION"
MISC,"Thus each model corresponds to a program , and there are countably many programs"
MISC,"Moreover , the models are stochastic , precisely they are   semimeasures   on strings ( programs need not halt , otherwise the models were even measures )"
MISC,"Each model has a natural description length , namely the length of the corresponding program"
MISC,"If we agree that programs are binary strings , then a prior is defined by two to the negative description length"
MISC,"By the Kraft inequality , the priors sum up to at most one"
MISC,Also the Bernoulli case can be studied in the view of Algorithmic Information Theory
MISC,"We call this the   universal setup : Given a universal Turing machine , the related class of Bernoulli distributions is isomorphic to the countable set of computable reals in   SYMBOL"
MISC,The description length   SYMBOL   of a parameter   SYMBOL   is then given by the length of its shortest program
MISC,A prior weight may then be defined by   SYMBOL
MISC,"If a string   SYMBOL   is generated by a Bernoulli distribution with computable parameter   SYMBOL , then with high probability the two - part complexity of   SYMBOL   with respect to the Bernoulli class does not exceed its algorithmic complexity by more than a constant , as shown by Vovk   CITATION"
MISC,"That is , the two - part complexity with respect to the Bernoulli class   is   the shortest description , save for an additive constant"
MISC,Many Machine Learning tasks are or can be reduced to sequence prediction tasks
MISC,An important example is classification
MISC,"The task of classifying a new instance   SYMBOL   after having seen ( instance , class ) pairs   SYMBOL   can be phrased as to predict the continuation of the sequence   SYMBOL"

 # # # introduction # # #"
MISC,the rapid expansion of the internet in the last two decades has produced a large scale system of thousands of diverse   independently managed networks that collectively provide global connectivity across a wide spectrum of geopolitical environments
MISC,from   NUMBER   to   NUMBER   the number of globally routable as identifiers has increased from less than   NUMBER    NUMBER   to more than   NUMBER    NUMBER    exerting significant pressure on interdomain routing as well as other functional and structural parts of the internet
MISC,this impressive growth has resulted in a heterogenous and highly complex system that challenges accurate and realistic modeling of the internet infrastructure
MISC,in particular   the as level topology is an intermix of networks owned and operated by many different organizations   e g    backbone providers   regional providers   access providers   universities and private companies
MISC,statistical information that faithfully characterizes different as types is on the critical path toward understanding the structure of the internet   as well as for modeling its topology and growth
MISC,in topology modeling   knowledge of as types is mandatory for augmenting synthetically constructed or measured as topologies with realistic intra as and inter as router level topologies
MISC,for example   we expect the network of a dual homed university to be drastically different from that of a dual homed small company
MISC,the university will likely contain dozens of internal routers   thousands of hosts   and many other network elements   switches   servers   firewalls
MISC,on the other hand   the small company will most probably have a single router and a simple network topology
MISC,since there is such a diversity among different network types   we can not accurately augment the as level topology with appropriate router level topologies if we can not
MISC,characterize the composing ases
MISC,moreover   annotating the ases in the as topology with their types is a prerequisite for modeling the evolution of the internet   since different types of ases exhibit different growth patterns
MISC,for example   internet service providers   isp   grow by attracting new customers and by engaging in business agreements with other isps
MISC,on the other hand   small companies that connect to the internet through one or few isps do not grow significantly over time
MISC,thus   categorizing different types of ases in the internet is necessary to identify network evolution patterns and develop accurate evolution models
MISC,an as taxonomy is also necessary for mapping ip addresses to different types of users
MISC,for example   in traffic analysis studies its often required to distinguish between packets that come from home and business users
MISC,given an as taxonomy   its possible to realize this goal by checking the type of as that originates the prefix in which an ip address lies
AIMX,in this work   we introduce a radically new approach based on machine learning to construct a representative as taxonomy
OWNX,we develop an algorithm to classify ases based on empirically observed differences between as characteristics
OWNX,we use a large set of data from the internet routing registries   irr    CITATION   and from routeviews   CITATION   to identify intrinsic differences between ases of different types
AIMX,then   we employ a novel machine learning technique to build a classification algorithm that exploits these differences to classify ases into six representative classes that reflect ases with different network properties and infrastructures
OWNX,we derive macroscopic statistics on the different types of ases in the internet and validate our results using a sample of   NUMBER   manually identified as types
OWNX,our validation demonstrates that our classification algorithm achieves high accuracy    NUMBER    NUMBER   percent   of the examined classifications were correct

MISC,"The rapid expansion of the Internet in the last two decades has produced a large - scale system of thousands of diverse , independently managed networks that collectively provide global connectivity across a wide spectrum of geopolitical environments"
MISC,"From 1997 to 2005 the number of globally routable AS identifiers has increased from less than 2,000 to more than 20,000 , exerting significant pressure on interdomain routing as well as other functional and structural parts of the Internet"
MISC,This impressive growth has resulted in a heterogenous and highly complex system that challenges accurate and realistic modeling of the Internet infrastructure
MISC,"In particular , the AS - level topology is an intermix of networks owned and operated by many different organizations , e g , backbone providers , regional providers , access providers , universities and private companies"
MISC,"Statistical information that faithfully characterizes different AS types is on the critical path toward understanding the structure of the Internet , as well as for modeling its topology and growth"
MISC,"In topology modeling , knowledge of AS types is mandatory for augmenting synthetically constructed or measured AS topologies with realistic intra - AS and inter - AS router - level topologies"
MISC,"For example , we expect the network of a dual - homed university to be drastically different from that of a dual - homed small company"
MISC,"The university will likely contain dozens of internal routers , thousands of hosts , and many other network elements ( switches , servers , firewalls )"
MISC,"On the other hand , the small company will most probably have a single router and a simple network topology"
MISC,"Since there is such a diversity among different network types , we can not accurately augment the AS - level topology with appropriate router - level topologies if we can not characterize the composing ASes"
MISC,"Moreover , annotating the ASes in the AS topology with their types is a prerequisite for modeling the evolution of the Internet , since different types of ASes exhibit different growth patterns"
MISC,"For example , Internet Service Providers ( ISP ) grow by attracting new customers and by engaging in business agreements with other ISPs"
MISC,"On the other hand , small companies that connect to the Internet through one or few ISPs do not grow significantly over time"
MISC,"Thus , categorizing different types of ASes in the Internet is necessary to identify network evolution patterns and develop accurate evolution models"
MISC,An AS taxonomy is also necessary for mapping IP addresses to different types of users
MISC,"For example , in traffic analysis studies its often required to distinguish between packets that come from home and business users"
MISC,"Given an AS taxonomy , its possible to realize this goal by checking the type of AS that originates the prefix in which an IP address lies"
AIMX,"In this work , we introduce a radically new approach based on machine learning to construct a representative AS taxonomy"
OWNX,We develop an algorithm to classify ASes based on empirically observed differences between AS characteristics
BASE,We use a large set of data from the Internet Routing Registries~(IRR)~ CITATION   and from RouteViews~ CITATION   to identify intrinsic differences between ASes of different types
OWNX,"Then , we employ a novel machine learning technique to build a classification algorithm that exploits these differences to classify ASes into six representative classes that reflect ASes with different network properties and infrastructures"
OWNX,We derive macroscopic statistics on the different types of ASes in the Internet and validate our results using a sample of~1200 manually identified AS types
OWNX,Our validation demonstrates that our classification algorithm achieves high accuracy:~78 1\% of the examined classifications were correct
OWNX,"Finally , we make our results and our classifier publicly available to promote further research and understanding of the Internet 's structure and evolution"
OWNX,In Section~ we start with a brief discussion of related work
OWNX,"Section~ describes the data we used , and in Section~ we specify the set of AS classes we use in our experiments"
OWNX,Section~ introduces our classification approach and results
OWNX,We validate them in Section~ and conclude in Section~

MISC,finding the optimal treatment of these    loop errors     motivates an active field of research   in which   different solutions applying to different model classes are developed

MISC,the latter may also be   applied to correct for an incidental large loop
MISC,unifying frameworks like the region graphs of   CITATION    lead to general strategies for selecting the basic clusters underlying such approaches for general model classes
MISC,a recent analysis has shown that the local update equations of bp may be interpreted as the zero order term of an expansion in    cavity connected correlations
MISC,these quantities are parameterizations of the    cavity distributions      i e    the   distribution over neighbor variables of a central variable which has been removed from the graph
MISC,the bethe approximation and bp are recovered when this   cavity distribution is assumed to factorize   whereas the first order correction to the local update equations is obtained when one takes into account the pair cumulants   CITATION

 # # # introduction # # #"
MISC,"Most generalization bounds in learning theory are based on some measure of the complexity of the hypothesis class used , such as the VC - dimension , covering numbers , or Rademacher complexity"
MISC,"These measures characterize a class of hypotheses , independently of any algorithm"
MISC,"In contrast , the notion of algorithmic stability can be used to derive bounds that are tailored to specific learning algorithms and exploit their particular properties"
MISC,A learning algorithm is stable if the hypothesis it outputs varies in a limited way in response to small changes made to the training set
MISC,Algorithmic stability has been used effectively in the past to derive tight generalization bounds   CITATION
MISC,"But , as in much of learning theory , existing stability analyses and bounds apply only in the scenario where the samples are independently and identically distributed ( iid )"
MISC,"In many machine learning applications , this assumption , however , does not hold ; in fact , the iid assumption is not tested or derived from any data analysis"
MISC,The observations received by the learning algorithm often have some inherent temporal dependence
MISC,This is clear in system diagnosis or time series prediction problems
MISC,"Clearly , prices of different stocks on the same day , or of the same stock on different days , may be dependent"
MISC,"But , a less apparent time dependency may affect data sampled in many other tasks as well"
AIMX,"This paper studies the scenario where the observations are drawn from a stationary   SYMBOL -mixing or   SYMBOL -mixing sequence , a widely adopted assumption in the study of non - iid processes that implies a dependence between observations weakening over time   CITATION"
OWNX,We prove novel and distinct stability - based generalization bounds for stationary   SYMBOL -mixing and   SYMBOL -mixing sequences
OWNX,"These bounds strictly generalize the bounds given in the iid case and apply to all stable learning algorithms , thereby extending the usefulness of stability - bounds to non - iid scenarios"
BASE,"Our proofs are based on the independent block technique described by   CITATION   and attributed to   CITATION , which is commonly used in such contextsMISC"
CONT,"However , our analysis differs from previous uses of this technique in that the blocks of points considered are not of equal size"
BASE,"For our analysis of stationary   SYMBOL -mixing sequences , we make use of a generalized version of McDiarmid 's inequality   CITATION   that holds for   SYMBOL -mixing sequences"
OWNX,This leads to stability - based generalization bounds with the standard exponential form
OWNX,"Our generalization bounds for stationary   SYMBOL -mixing sequences cover a more general non - iid scenario and use the standard McDiarmid 's inequality , however , unlike the   SYMBOL -mixing case , the   SYMBOL -mixing bound presented here is not a purely exponential bound and contains an additive term depending on the mixing coefficient"
OWNX,"We also illustrate the application of our   SYMBOL -mixing generalization bounds to general classes of learning algorithms , including Support Vector Regression ( SVR )   CITATION , Kernel Ridge Regression   CITATION , and Support Vector Machines ( SVMs )   CITATION"
MISC,"Algorithms such as support vector regression ( SVR )   CITATION   have been used in the context of time series prediction in which the iid assumption does not hold , some with good experimental results   CITATION"
MISC,"To our knowledge , the use of these algorithms in non - iid scenarios has not been previously supported by any theoretical analysis"
OWNX,"The stability bounds we give for SVR , SVMs , and many other kernel regularization - based and relative entropy - based regularization algorithms can thus be viewed as the first theoretical basis for their use in such scenarios"

 # # # introduction # # #"
MISC,clustering is one of the most popular methods in data mining

MISC,qa has succeeded in specific problems   e g the ising model in statistical mechanics   and it is still unclear that qa works better than sa in general
OWNX,we do not actually think qa intuitively helps clustering   but we apply qa to clustering just as procedure to derive an algorithm
MISC,a derived qa algorithm depends on the definition of quantum effect
OWNX,we propose quantum effect     which leads to a search strategy fit to clustering
AIMX,our contribution is 1 ) to propose a qa based optimization algorithm for clustering in particular quantum effect for clustering and a good annealing schedule   which is crucial for applications 2 ) and to experimentally show the proposed algorithm optimizes clustering assignments better than sa
OWNX,we also show the proposed algorithm is as easy as sa to implement
OWNX,the algorithm we propose is a markov chain monte carlo   mcmc   sampler   which we call qa st sampler
OWNX,as we explain later   a naive qa sampler is intractable even with mcmc
OWNX,thus   we approximate qa by the suzuki trotter   st   expansion   CITATION   to derive a tractable sampler   which is the qa st sampler
OWNX,qa st looks like parallel    sas with interaction     see fig

OWNX,hence   qa st finds     local   optima independently
OWNX,as the annealing process continues   interaction    in fig becomes stronger to move    states closer
OWNX,qa st at the end picks up the state with the lowest energy in    states as the final solution

OWNX,we suggest selecting the model complexity    that has minimal loss rank   lorp

AIMX,"in this paper we formalize   discuss   and motivate lorp   study it for specific regression problems   in particular linear ones   and compare it to other model selection schemes 
 # # # introduction # # #"
OWNX,consider a regression or classification problem in which we want to determine the functional relationship    from data     i e    we seek a function    such that    is close to the unknown    for all
MISC,one may define regressor    directly   e g     average the    values of the    nearest neighbors   knn   of    in      or select the    from a class of functions    that has smallest   training   error on
MISC,if the class    is not too large   e g the polynomials of fixed reasonable degree     this often works well
MISC,what remains is to select the right model complexity     like    or
MISC,this selection can not be based on the training error   since the more complex the model   large     small     the better the fit on     perfect for    and
OWNX,this problem is called overfitting   for which various remedies have been suggested    we will not discuss empirical test set methods like cross validation   but only training set based methods
MISC,see e g     CITATION   for a comparison of cross validation with bayesian model selection
MISC,training set based model selection methods allow using all data    for regression
MISC,the most popular ones can be regarded as penalized versions of maximum likelihood   ml
MISC,in addition to the function class     one has to specify a sampling model     e g    that the    have independent gaussian distribution with mean
MISC,ml chooses     penalized ml   pml   then chooses   penalty    where the penalty depends on the used approach   mdl   CITATION    bic   CITATION    aic   CITATION
MISC,in particular   modern mdl   CITATION   has sound exact foundations and works very well in practice
CONT,all pml variants rely on a proper sampling model   which may be difficult to establish    ignore   or at least do not tell how to incorporate   a potentially given loss function   and are typically limited to   semi parametric models
AIMX,the main goal of the paper is to establish a criterion for selecting the    best    model complexity    % based on regressors    given as a black box without insight into the origin or inner structure of     % that does not depend on things often not given   like a stochastic noise model    % and that exploits what is given   like the loss function
OWNX,the key observation we exploit is that large classes    or more flexible regressors    can fit more data    well than more rigid ones   e g    many    can be fit well with high order polynomials
OWNX,we define the   loss rank   of    as the number of other   fictitious   data    that are fitted better by    than    is fitted by     as measured by some loss function
MISC,the loss rank is large for regressors fitting    not well   and   for too flexible regressors   in both cases the regressor fits many other    better
MISC,the loss rank has a minimum for not too flexible regressors which fit    not too bad
OWNX,we claim that minimizing the loss rank is a suitable model selection criterion   since it trades off the quality of fit with the flexibility of the model
CONT,unlike pml   our new loss rank principle   lorp   works without a noise   stochastic sampling   model   and is directly applicable to any non parametric regressor   like knn
OWNX,in section    after giving a brief introduction to regression   we formally state lorp for model selection
OWNX,to make it applicable to real problems   we have to generalize it to continuous spaces and regularize infinite loss ranks
OWNX,in section   we derive explicit expressions for the loss rank for the important class of linear regressors   which includes knn   polynomial   linear basis function   lbfr    kernel   and projective regression
OWNX,in section   we compare linear lorp to bayesian model selection for linear regression with gaussian noise and prior   and in section   to pml   in particular mdl   bic   aic   and mackay s   CITATION   and hastie s et al     CITATION   trace formulas for the effective dimension

MISC,"One may define regressor   SYMBOL   directly , eg ` average the   SYMBOL   values of the   SYMBOL   nearest neighbors ( kNN ) of   SYMBOL   in   SYMBOL ' , or select the   SYMBOL   from a class of functions   SYMBOL   that has smallest ( training ) error on   SYMBOL"
MISC,"If the class   SYMBOL   is not too large , e g the polynomials of fixed reasonable degree   SYMBOL , this often works well"
MISC,"What remains is to select the right model complexity   SYMBOL , like   SYMBOL   or   SYMBOL"
MISC,"This selection can not be based on the training error , since the more complex the model ( large   SYMBOL , small   SYMBOL ) the better the fit on   SYMBOL   ( perfect for   SYMBOL   and   SYMBOL )"
MISC,"This problem is called overfitting , for which various remedies have been suggested :   We will not discuss empirical test set methods like cross - validation , but only training set based methods"
MISC,See eg CITATION   for a comparison of cross - validation with Bayesian model selection
MISC,Training set based model selection methods allow using all data   SYMBOL   for regression
MISC,The most popular ones can be regarded as penalized versions of Maximum Likelihood ( ML )
MISC,"In addition to the function class   SYMBOL , one has to specify a sampling model   SYMBOL , eg that the   SYMBOL   have independent Gaussian distribution with mean   SYMBOL"
MISC,"ML chooses   SYMBOL , Penalized ML ( PML ) then chooses   SYMBOL Penalty SYMBOL , where the penalty depends on the used approach ( MDL   CITATION , BIC   CITATION , AIC   CITATION )"
MISC,"In particular , modern MDL   CITATION   has sound exact foundations and works very well in practice"
CONT,"All PML variants rely on a proper sampling model ( which may be difficult to establish ) , ignore ( or at least do not tell how to incorporate ) a potentially given loss function , and are typically limited to ( semi)parametric models"
AIMX,"The main goal of the paper is to establish a criterion for selecting the ` ` best '' model complexity   SYMBOL based on regressors   SYMBOL   given as a black box without insight into the origin or inner structure of   SYMBOL , that does not depend on things often not given ( like a stochastic noise model ) ,   and that exploits what is given ( like the loss function )"
OWNX,"The key observation we exploit is that large classes   SYMBOL   or more flexible regressors   SYMBOL   can fit more data   SYMBOL   well than more rigid ones , eg many   SYMBOL   can be fit well with high order polynomials"
OWNX,"We define the   loss rank   of   SYMBOL   as the number of other ( fictitious ) data   SYMBOL   that are fitted better by   SYMBOL   than   SYMBOL   is fitted by   SYMBOL , as measured by some loss function"
OWNX,The loss rank is large for regressors fitting   SYMBOL   not well   and   for too flexible regressors ( in both cases the regressor fits many other   SYMBOL   better )
OWNX,The loss rank has a minimum for not too flexible regressors which fit   SYMBOL   not too bad
OWNX,"We claim that minimizing the loss rank is a suitable model selection criterion , since it trades off the quality of fit with the flexibility of the model"
CONT,"Unlike PML , our new Loss Rank Principle ( LoRP ) works without a noise ( stochastic sampling ) model , and is directly applicable to any non - parametric regressor , like kNN"
OWNX,"In Section , after giving a brief introduction to regression , we formally state LoRP for model selection"
OWNX,"To make it applicable to real problems , we have to generalize it to continuous spaces and regularize infinite loss ranks"
OWNX,"In Section   we derive explicit expressions for the loss rank for the important class of linear regressors , which includes kNN , polynomial , linear basis function ( LBFR ) , Kernel , and projective regression"
OWNX,"In Section   we compare linear LoRP to Bayesian model selection for linear regression with Gaussian noise and prior , and in Section   to PML , in particular MDL , BIC , AIC , and MacKay 's   CITATION   and Hastie 's et al   CITATION   trace formulas for the effective dimension"
OWNX,In this paper we just scratch at the surface of LoRP
OWNX,"Section   contains further considerations , to be elaborated on in the future"

OWNX,to accomplish this   we propose a sparse variant of the indian buffet process and couple this with a hierarchical model over factors   based on kingman s coalescent
AIMX,"we apply this model to two problems   factor analysis and factor regression   in gene expression data analysis

MISC,factor analysis is the task of explaining data by means of a set of   latent factors

OWNX,this prior explains the fact that pathways are fundamentally related   some are involved in transcription   some in signaling   some in synthesis
OWNX,the nonparametric nature of our sparse ibp requires that the hierarchical prior   also   be nonparametric

MISC,"# # # abstract # # # 
 Regularized risk minimization with the binary hinge loss and its variants lies at the heart of many machine learning problems"
MISC,Bundle methods for regularized risk minimization ( BMRM ) and the closely related SVMStruct are considered the best general purpose solvers to tackle this problem
MISC,It was recently shown that BMRM requires   SYMBOL   iterations to converge to an   SYMBOL   accurate solution
AIMX,In the first part of the paper we use the Hadamard matrix to construct a regularized risk minimization problem and show that these rates can not be improved
AIMX,"We then show how one can exploit the structure of the objective function to devise an algorithm for the binary hinge loss which converges to an   SYMBOL   accurate solution in   SYMBOL   iterations 
 # # # introduction # # #"
MISC,Let   SYMBOL   denote samples and   SYMBOL   be the corresponding labels
MISC,"Given a training set of   SYMBOL   sample label pairs   SYMBOL , drawn iid from a joint probability distribution on   SYMBOL , many machine learning algorithms solve the following regularized risk minimization problem :"
MISC,"Here   SYMBOL   denotes the loss on instance   SYMBOL   using the current model   SYMBOL   and   SYMBOL , the empirical risk , is the average loss on the training set"
MISC,The regularizer   SYMBOL   acts as a penalty on the complexity of the classifier and prevents overfitting
MISC,Usually the loss is convex in   SYMBOL   but can be nonsmooth while the regularizer is usually a smooth strongly convex function
MISC,Binary Support Vector Machines ( SVMs ) are a prototypical example of such regularized risk minimization problems where   SYMBOL   and the loss considered is the binary hinge loss :
MISC,"Recently , a number of solvers have been proposed for the regularized risk minimization problem"
MISC,"The first and perhaps the best known solver is SVMStruct   CITATION , which was shown to converge in   SYMBOL   iterations to an   SYMBOL   accurate solution"
MISC,The convergence analysis of SVMStruct was improved to   SYMBOL   iterations by   CITATION
MISC,"In fact ,   CITATION   showed that their convergence analysis holds for a more general solver than SVMStruct namely BMRM ( Bundle method for regularized risk minimization )"
MISC,At every iteration BMRM replaces   SYMBOL   by a piecewise linear lower bound   SYMBOL   and optimizes     to obtain the next iterate   SYMBOL
MISC,Here   SYMBOL   denotes an arbitrary subgradient of   SYMBOL   at   SYMBOL   ( see Section ) and   SYMBOL
MISC,The piecewise linear lower bound is successively tightened until the gap      falls below a predefined tolerance   SYMBOL
MISC,"Even though BMRM solves an expensive optimization problem at every iteration , the convergence analysis only uses a simple one - dimensional line search to bound the decrease in   SYMBOL"
MISC,"Furthermore , the empirical convergence behavior of BMRM is much better than the theoretically predicted rates on a number of real life problems"
MISC,It was therefore conjectured that the rates of convergence of BMRM could be improved
AIMX,In this paper we answer this question in the negative by explicitly constructing a regularized risk minimization problem for which BMRM takes at least   SYMBOL   iterations

MISC,self - control - our capacity to overrule temptation - is no less complex than it is important
MISC,"a multitude of conceptualizations exist , many of which are complementary"
MISC,"typically , and in line with classic ideas of the conflict between reason and passion , authors view self - control as a "" cold "" executive function that guides behavior in the face of "" hot "" impulses to act against better judgment   CITATION"

MISC,"such resources may include cognitive strategies to divert attention away from temptation   CITATION , strategies of pre - commitment   CITATION , or possibly the sheer strength of mind to hold back from the song of the sirens"
MISC,our conceptualization of self - control mirrors these
MISC,only recently has the psychological literature started to explore how the question of pro - social versus selfish behavior relates to that of self - control
MISC,"loewenstein   CITATION   suggests that selfish behavior may be motivated by visceral urges or drive - states , resembling cravings for relief from hunger , pain , and sexual deprivation"
MISC,"o'donoghue and loewenstein   CITATION   argue that such selfish urges may conflict with the "" colder "" , more abstract preferences for altruism , as visceral urges for sweets may conflict with more abstract preferences for a fine figure or good health"
CONT,"at present , there is but indirect evidence for this idea"
MISC,"for example , pronin et al CITATION   show that decisions about others resemble decisions about "" future selves "" , both classes of which contrast to decisions about less abstract "" present selves """
MISC,albrecht et al CITATION   report consistent results ; individuals who choose between immediate and delayed rewards for themselves exhibit less patience and more affective involvement activation in the dopaminergic reward system than do individuals who make such choices for others - or for themselves in the future
MISC,"moreover , curry et al CITATION   find in a standard public goods game that individuals ' discount rates are negatively associated with their contributions to the public good"
MISC,"that is , more "" impatient "" individuals contributed less to the public good than did "" patient "" ones"
MISC,"arriving at similar results , fehr and leibbrandt   CITATION   report that patient vs impatient fishermen , whose time preferences were elicited in the lab , exhibited more cooperative behavior in a common resource problem and were in the field less likely to over - exploit the common pool resource"
MISC,"furthermore , burks et al CITATION   find that "" short - term "" patience - the   beta    in the   beta   -&#x3b4 ;   model - is positively associated with cooperative behavior in a sequential prisoner 's dilemma"
MISC,"however , duffy and smith   CITATION   report no effect of cognitive load - a manipulation intended to deplete cognitive resources and thereby impair self - control - on outcomes across treatments in a repeated multi - player prisoner 's dilemma"
MISC,"an emerging literature on the "" default "" response in games of trust and reciprocity lends further credence to the notion that altruistic responses require self - control"
MISC,"achtziger et al CITATION   subjected players in an ultimatum game to cognitive resource depletion , and show that depleted proposers made lower offers - they became less altruistic"
MISC,"moreover , depleted responders were more likely to reject offers that were unfair to themselves - they exhibited "" altruistic punishment """
MISC,"halali et al CITATION   report the same for responders , but with a different depletion task"
MISC,crockett et al CITATION   subjected responders to acute tryptophan depletion - a procedure that temporarily reduces serotonin levels in the brain and thereby impairs self - control   CITATION ; reduced serotonin levels raised rejection rates and this reduction is positively correlated with impulsive choice in a delay - discounting task   CITATION
MISC,"using a trust game , knoch et al CITATION   subjected trustees ' right lateral prefrontal cortex to transcranial magnetic stimulation , which reduces functioning in the targeted brain region"
MISC,"trustees , though cognizant that returning a share of the investments was both strategic and norm - compliant , were unable to do so under impaired executive functioning ; self - control seems necessary to act on the better judgment to resist the temptation to keep the received investment entirely for oneself"
MISC,"closest to our domain of inquiry , piovesan and wengstrom   CITATION   measured response times of participants in a repeated dictator game , lasting 24 periods"
MISC,they find both across and within participants that lower response times are associated with more selfish choices
MISC,"one interpretation of their results is that the default behavior is to act selfishly and that pro - social behavior requires the successful resolution of a self - control conflict , which slows the response time"
MISC,"such successful resolution of conflict would require cognitive resources , but hauge et al CITATION   report no effect of cognitive load on players in one - shot dictator games"
AIMX,in this paper we attempt a more direct test of the hypothesis that pro - social versus selfish behavior may represent a self - control problem
OWNX,"we employ a standard measure of pure pro - social behavior , the one - shot dictator game , which invokes neither concerns for strategy nor for reciprocity ; and a well - grounded psychometric measure of self - control , the rosenbaum self - control schedule   CITATION"
OWNX,"further , we explore the conditions under which we expect an association between self - control and pro - social behavior"
BASE,"in so doing , we rely on two conditions necessary for successfully exercising restraint in the face of temptation ; myrseth and fishbach   CITATION   propose a two - stage model of self - control , which postulates that an individual in the face of temptation first identifies conflict or not between indulging and pursuing a higher - order goal and , second , that the individual next employs self - control strategies if and only if conflict was identified at the first stage see figure 1"
MISC,"critically , self - control strategies are relevant to the decision to indulge only when the individual has identified self - control conflict"
MISC,"therefore , one strategy for investigating whether the problem of pro - social versus selfish behavior resembles one of self - control is to test whether the tendency to apply self - control strategies is positively associated with pro - social behavior when individuals have identified self - control conflict , but less so or not at all when individuals have not"
MISC,determinants of conflict identification in the face of temptation have been explored only recently
MISC,"in some contexts , the question is almost trivial and identification of conflict virtually obvious"
MISC,"for example , the diabetic dieter probably knows that having even a single , tempting chocolate may incur major costs"
MISC,"however , the question of self - control conflict is more ambiguous for the non - diabetic dieter , who faces the same chocolate"
MISC,"having this one chocolate alone will not incur major costs , but doing so regularly might"
MISC,"similarly , the good citizen may find that a general failure to act generously would represent a major threat to his self - image , but being stingy on just a couple of occasions is a more ambiguous matter"
MISC,"myrseth and fishbach   CITATION   use the term epsilon cost temptation to denote tempting opportunities that incur nothing but trivial costs when consumed in small amounts , but potentially serious costs when consumed extensively"
MISC,"they argue that individuals identify self - control conflict in the face of epsilon cost temptation if and only if two conditions are met : a the focal consumption opportunity must be viewed in relation to multiple additional opportunities , and b the decision maker must assume that similar choices are made for each opportunity   CITATION"
MISC,"that is , considering the question of whether or not to have a delicious creamy cake will evoke self - control conflict in the dieter if the dining opportunity is viewed in relation to future opportunities for dessert consumption , but not if the dining opportunity is viewed in isolation , as a singular episode"
MISC,"similarly , the question of whether or not to be generous - to donate to a charitable organization - may elicit self - control conflict if the decision is viewed in relation to future decisions , but not if the decision is viewed in isolation"
MISC,"if viewed in relation to future decisions , the question of how much to donate on a single occasion may have bearing on the decision maker 's self - image ; donating now - and in the future - indicates a generous character , whereas keeping the money for oneself does not"
MISC,"however , if viewed in isolation , the question of how much to donate has little bearing on self - image ; the present decision of how much to donate is considered only in light of immediate consequences , leaving self - image out of the equation"
MISC,"because a consistent self - image represents an important motivator for pro - social behavior   CITATION , we expect that individuals are more likely to identify self - control conflict between selfish and pro - social behavior if the allocation decision is seen in relation to future opportunities than if it is seen in isolation"
MISC,myrseth and fishbach   CITATION   show that subtle framing manipulations are sufficient to influence identification of self - control conflict in the face of epsilon cost temptation
MISC,"they find that presenting a calendar displaying the current month , with a grid separating the dates , raised participants ' subsequent consumption of potato chips relative to that of participants whom were presented a calendar without a grid"
MISC,they argue that the gridded calendar activated an isolated versus interrelated frame of the choice opportunity ; it made participants more likely to isolate the date in question and thus less likely to see the decision task in relation to similar future opportunities
MISC,"consequently , the grid reduced the likelihood that participants would identify a conflict between the temptation to have chips and the better judgment to maintain a fine figure and good health"
MISC,"indeed , participants who viewed the gridded calendar reported experiencing less conflict during their decision to have chips or not than did those who viewed the non - gridded calendar"
MISC,"furthermore , participants ' trait ability to implement self - control strategies , measured by rosenbaum 's   CITATION   psychometric scale , was positively associated with chips consumption for those who viewed the calendar without the grid and who were more likely to identify conflict , but not for others who viewed the calendar with and who were less likely to identify conflict"
MISC,"that is , participants who viewed the calendar without the grid , more likely than those who viewed the calendar with , identified self - control conflict and therefore leveraged their self - control strategies to resist the tempting chips"
OWNX,"to explore our hypothesis that the problem of pro - social versus selfish behavior may represent one of self - control , we have applied the empirical strategy from myrseth and fishbach   CITATION   in the dictator game - a participant is granted an endowment and asked to split it between herself and a recipient   CITATION , and in our case the red cross featured as recipient   CITATION"
OWNX,the game thus pits pro - social motivations against self - interest
OWNX,"if pro - social versus selfish behavior could represent a self - control conflict , we would expect participants ' trait self - control , as measured by rosenbaum 's   CITATION   scale , to correlate positively with pro - social behavior for participants who have just previously viewed a calendar without a grid , but less so or not at all for participants who have viewed a calendar with"

OWNX,"in the case of low likelihood , the slope is expected to be weakly positive"
OWNX,"in the case of the higher likelihood , however , the slope is expected to be strictly greater than that in the case of low likelihood"
OWNX,"this means that for a given level of self - control , one might observe substantially different donation behavior depending on whether conflict was identified or not"

MISC,"that is , pro - social preferences potentially fly in the face of basic urges for personal gain - or greed - and the individual may thus experience a self - control conflict between better judgment to act pro - socially and the temptation to act selfishly"
MISC,self - control - our capacity to overrule temptation - is no less complex than it is important
MISC,"a multitude of conceptualizations exist , many of which are complementary"
MISC,"typically , and in line with classic ideas of the conflict between reason and passion , authors view self - control as a "" cold "" executive function that guides behavior in the face of "" hot "" impulses to act against better judgment   CITATION"
MISC,"willpower , then , represents the combined resources that the executive function - or the planner , in the parlance of thaler and shefrin   CITATION -brings to bear in a deliberate struggle against temptation   CITATION"
MISC,"such resources may include cognitive strategies to divert attention away from temptation   CITATION , strategies of pre - commitment   CITATION , or possibly the sheer strength of mind to hold back from the song of the sirens"
OWNX,our conceptualization of self - control mirrors these
MISC,only recently has the psychological literature started to explore how the question of pro - social versus selfish behavior relates to that of self - control
MISC,"loewenstein   CITATION   suggests that selfish behavior may be motivated by visceral urges or drive - states , resembling cravings for relief from hunger , pain , and sexual deprivation"
MISC,"o'donoghue and loewenstein   CITATION   argue that such selfish urges may conflict with the "" colder "" , more abstract preferences for altruism , as visceral urges for sweets may conflict with more abstract preferences for a fine figure or good health"
MISC,"at present , there is but indirect evidence for this idea"
MISC,"for example , pronin et al CITATION   show that decisions about others resemble decisions about "" future selves "" , both classes of which contrast to decisions about less abstract "" present selves """
MISC,albrecht et al CITATION   report consistent results ; individuals who choose between immediate and delayed rewards for themselves exhibit less patience and more affective involvement activation in the dopaminergic reward system than do individuals who make such choices for others - or for themselves in the future
MISC,"moreover , curry et al CITATION   find in a standard public goods game that individuals ' discount rates are negatively associated with their contributions to the public good"
MISC,"that is , more "" impatient "" individuals contributed less to the public good than did "" patient "" ones"
MISC,"arriving at similar results , fehr and leibbrandt   CITATION   report that patient vs impatient fishermen , whose time preferences were elicited in the lab , exhibited more cooperative behavior in a common resource problem and were in the field less likely to over - exploit the common pool resource"
MISC,"furthermore , burks et al CITATION   find that "" short - term "" patience - the   beta    in the   beta   -&#x3b4 ;   model - is positively associated with cooperative behavior in a sequential prisoner 's dilemma"
MISC,"however , duffy and smith   CITATION   report no effect of cognitive load - a manipulation intended to deplete cognitive resources and thereby impair self - control - on outcomes across treatments in a repeated multi - player prisoner 's dilemma"
MISC,"an emerging literature on the "" default "" response in games of trust and reciprocity lends further credence to the notion that altruistic responses require self - control"
MISC,"achtziger et al CITATION   subjected players in an ultimatum game to cognitive resource depletion , and show that depleted proposers made lower offers - they became less altruistic"
MISC,"moreover , depleted responders were more likely to reject offers that were unfair to themselves - they exhibited "" altruistic punishment """
MISC,"halali et al CITATION   report the same for responders , but with a different depletion task"
MISC,crockett et al CITATION   subjected responders to acute tryptophan depletion - a procedure that temporarily reduces serotonin levels in the brain and thereby impairs self - control   CITATION ; reduced serotonin levels raised rejection rates and this reduction is positively correlated with impulsive choice in a delay - discounting task   CITATION
MISC,"using a trust game , knoch et al CITATION   subjected trustees ' right lateral prefrontal cortex to transcranial magnetic stimulation , which reduces functioning in the targeted brain region"
MISC,"trustees , though cognizant that returning a share of the investments was both strategic and norm - compliant , were unable to do so under impaired executive functioning ; self - control seems necessary to act on the better judgment to resist the temptation to keep the received investment entirely for oneself"
MISC,"closest to our domain of inquiry , piovesan and wengstrom   CITATION   measured response times of participants in a repeated dictator game , lasting 24 periods"
MISC,they find both across and within participants that lower response times are associated with more selfish choices
MISC,"one interpretation of their results is that the default behavior is to act selfishly and that pro - social behavior requires the successful resolution of a self - control conflict , which slows the response time"
MISC,"such successful resolution of conflict would require cognitive resources , but hauge et al CITATION   report no effect of cognitive load on players in one - shot dictator games"
AIMX,in this paper we attempt a more direct test of the hypothesis that pro - social versus selfish behavior may represent a self - control problem
OWNX,"we employ a standard measure of pure pro - social behavior , the one - shot dictator game , which invokes neither concerns for strategy nor for reciprocity ; and a well - grounded psychometric measure of self - control , the rosenbaum self - control schedule   CITATION"
OWNX,"further , we explore the conditions under which we expect an association between self - control and pro - social behavior"
BASE,"in so doing , we rely on two conditions necessary for successfully exercising restraint in the face of temptation ; myrseth and fishbach   CITATION   propose a two - stage model of self - control , which postulates that an individual in the face of temptation first identifies conflict or not between indulging and pursuing a higher - order goal and , second , that the individual next employs self - control strategies if and only if conflict was identified at the first stage see figure 1"
MISC,"critically , self - control strategies are relevant to the decision to indulge only when the individual has identified self - control conflict"
MISC,"therefore , one strategy for investigating whether the problem of pro - social versus selfish behavior resembles one of self - control is to test whether the tendency to apply self - control strategies is positively associated with pro - social behavior when individuals have identified self - control conflict , but less so or not at all when individuals have not"
MISC,determinants of conflict identification in the face of temptation have been explored only recently
MISC,"in some contexts , the question is almost trivial and identification of conflict virtually obvious"
MISC,"for example , the diabetic dieter probably knows that having even a single , tempting chocolate may incur major costs"
MISC,"however , the question of self - control conflict is more ambiguous for the non - diabetic dieter , who faces the same chocolate"
MISC,"having this one chocolate alone will not incur major costs , but doing so regularly might"
MISC,"similarly , the good citizen may find that a general failure to act generously would represent a major threat to his self - image , but being stingy on just a couple of occasions is a more ambiguous matter"
MISC,"myrseth and fishbach   CITATION   use the term epsilon cost temptation to denote tempting opportunities that incur nothing but trivial costs when consumed in small amounts , but potentially serious costs when consumed extensively"
MISC,"they argue that individuals identify self - control conflict in the face of epsilon cost temptation if and only if two conditions are met : a the focal consumption opportunity must be viewed in relation to multiple additional opportunities , and b the decision maker must assume that similar choices are made for each opportunity   CITATION"
MISC,"that is , considering the question of whether or not to have a delicious creamy cake will evoke self - control conflict in the dieter if the dining opportunity is viewed in relation to future opportunities for dessert consumption , but not if the dining opportunity is viewed in isolation , as a singular episode"
MISC,"similarly , the question of whether or not to be generous - to donate to a charitable organization - may elicit self - control conflict if the decision is viewed in relation to future decisions , but not if the decision is viewed in isolation"
MISC,"if viewed in relation to future decisions , the question of how much to donate on a single occasion may have bearing on the decision maker 's self - image ; donating now - and in the future - indicates a generous character , whereas keeping the money for oneself does not"
MISC,"however , if viewed in isolation , the question of how much to donate has little bearing on self - image ; the present decision of how much to donate is considered only in light of immediate consequences , leaving self - image out of the equation"
OWNX,"because a consistent self - image represents an important motivator for pro - social behavior   CITATION , we expect that individuals are more likely to identify self - control conflict between selfish and pro - social behavior if the allocation decision is seen in relation to future opportunities than if it is seen in isolation"
MISC,myrseth and fishbach   CITATION   show that subtle framing manipulations are sufficient to influence identification of self - control conflict in the face of epsilon cost temptation
MISC,"they find that presenting a calendar displaying the current month , with a grid separating the dates , raised participants ' subsequent consumption of potato chips relative to that of participants whom were presented a calendar without a grid"
MISC,they argue that the gridded calendar activated an isolated versus interrelated frame of the choice opportunity ; it made participants more likely to isolate the date in question and thus less likely to see the decision task in relation to similar future opportunities
MISC,"consequently , the grid reduced the likelihood that participants would identify a conflict between the temptation to have chips and the better judgment to maintain a fine figure and good health"
MISC,"indeed , participants who viewed the gridded calendar reported experiencing less conflict during their decision to have chips or not than did those who viewed the non - gridded calendar"
MISC,"furthermore , participants ' trait ability to implement self - control strategies , measured by rosenbaum 's   CITATION   psychometric scale , was positively associated with chips consumption for those who viewed the calendar without the grid and who were more likely to identify conflict , but not for others who viewed the calendar with and who were less likely to identify conflict"
MISC,"that is , participants who viewed the calendar without the grid , more likely than those who viewed the calendar with , identified self - control conflict and therefore leveraged their self - control strategies to resist the tempting chips"
BASE,"to explore our hypothesis that the problem of pro - social versus selfish behavior may represent one of self - control , we have applied the empirical strategy from myrseth and fishbach   CITATION   in the dictator game - a participant is granted an endowment and asked to split it between herself and a recipient   CITATION , and in our case the red cross featured as recipient   CITATION"
OWNX,the game thus pits pro - social motivations against self - interest
OWNX,"if pro - social versus selfish behavior could represent a self - control conflict , we would expect participants ' trait self - control , as measured by rosenbaum 's   CITATION   scale , to correlate positively with pro - social behavior for participants who have just previously viewed a calendar without a grid , but less so or not at all for participants who have viewed a calendar with"
OWNX,"the graph in figure 2 displays donation , as a function of level of self - control , for two different levels of identification likelihood"
OWNX,"in the case of low likelihood , the slope is expected to be weakly positive"
OWNX,"in the case of the higher likelihood , however , the slope is expected to be strictly greater than that in the case of low likelihood"
OWNX,"this means that for a given level of self - control , one might observe substantially different donation behavior depending on whether conflict was identified or not"

MISC,"for example , the priority heuristic predicted fewer than half of the modal choices analyzed by birnbaum   CITATION , by birnbaum   CITATION , and by birnbaum and navarrete   CITATION"
MISC,some of these choices included cases where 90 % or more of the participants satisfied stochastic dominance but the priority heuristic predicts indifference
MISC,"in other choices , significantly more than half of the participants about 70 % of undergraduates violated stochastic dominance , but the priority heuristic predicts that people should satisfy it"
MISC,"brandstatter , gigerenzer , and hertwig   CITATION   responded that properties of these choices may have induced people to use other heuristics drawn from a person 's "" adaptive toolbox """
MISC,"presumably , decision makers first decide what rule to use , then they either apply that rule or choose to use another rule"
MISC,"the mechanism that decides what rule to use has not yet been specified ; it is described instead with lists of "" triggering conditions , "" which are estimated from data like parameters"
MISC,brandstatter et al CITATION   concluded that the priority heuristic does not apply when there is a stochastic dominance relation in the choice
MISC,"in addition , brandstatter et al CITATION   argued that certain choices reviewed by birnbaum   CITATION   used gambles that differed in expected value ev"
MISC,"brandstatter et al CITATION   presented a figure to show that the priority heuristic is not accurate when expected values evs differ , which led them to suppose that two strategies are at work , one for "" easy "" choices that differ in ev and one for "" harder "" choices where evs are nearly equal"
MISC,"from the data , brandstatter et al CITATION   estimated that , when the ratio of ev exceeds 2 , people act as if they choose the gamble with the higher ev"
MISC,"brandstatter et al consider ev ratio as a proxy for the "" difficulty "" of a choice , but do not necessarily hold that people actually compute ratios of ev"
MISC,"they argued that the priority heuristic is accurate for "" difficult "" choices in which evs are nearly equal"
MISC,"however , birnbaum   CITATION   noted that ev ratios in birnbaum and navarrete   CITATION   had been inside the region where ph is supposed to apply ; in that study , the priority heuristic failed to reproduce even half of the modal choices correctly"
MISC,brandstatter et al CITATION   replicated part of that study and their results confirmed that the priority heuristic reproduced fewer than half of the modal choices that they chose for replication   CITATION
MISC,"to account for the results , brandstatter et al noted that birnbaum and navarrete   CITATION   used many choices in which both gambles of a choice had the same probability distribution and in some choices two branches had the same probability"
MISC,"ph was not accurate for such choices , so brandstatter , et al CITATION   theorized that people use a "" toting up "" heuristic for choices in which two branches had the same probability"
MISC,"in some of the choices in birnbaum and navarrete   CITATION , there was a common probability - consequence branch in both choices , which was theorized to trigger editing rules and other heuristics that were called up to account for the failures of the priority heuristic"
MISC,the arguments of brandstatter et al CITATION   might also provide excuses for previous failures of cpt as well
AIMX,this paper devises a new type of test that avoids the exceptions stated above
OWNX,"in these tests , one alternative does not stochastically dominate the other , there are no common probability - consequence branches , probabilities of the consequences are not equal , and expected values are nearly equal"
CONT,"in addition , unlike previous tests , the new tests use shifts in expected value and expected utility to "" help "" predictions of ph and cpt"
OWNX,"that is , expected value and expected utility are both manipulated such that , if a person shifts his or her judgments in the same direction as the changes in eu or ev , his or her choices will appear consistent with ph and cpt"
OWNX,"however , the choices are designed so that the tax model with parameters typical of previous research predicts that people will shift their choices in the opposite direction of ev , eu , cpt , and ph"

MISC,according to tversky and kahneman 's   CITATION   availability heuristic   people sometimes judge the frequency of events in the world by the ease with which examples come to mind
MISC,this process has generally been demonstrated by asking participants to assess the relative likelihood of two categories in which instances of the first category are more difficult to recall than instances of the second category   despite the fact that instances of the first category are more common in the world
MISC,for instance   kahneman and tversky   CITATION   found that most people think the letter r more often appears in english words as the first letter than the third letter   presumably because the first letter provides a better cue for recalling instances of words than does the third letter
MISC,in fact   it turns out that r appears more often as the third than first letter in english words
MISC,schwarz et al CITATION   observed that the classic studies demonstrating the availability heuristic failed to distinguish an interpretation based on ease of retrieval from an alternative interpretation based on content of retrieval in which an event is judged more common when a larger number of examples come to mind
MISC,to tease apart these accounts   schwarz et al CITATION   asked participants in one    study to list either   NUMBER   or   NUMBER   examples of assertive or unassertive behavior that they have exhibited and then rate themselves on their overall degree of assertiveness
MISC,participants rated themselves as more assertive after they had listed   NUMBER   examples of assertive behavior a relatively easy task rather than   NUMBER   examples a relatively difficult task   similarly   they rated themselves as less assertive i e    more unassertive after they had listed   NUMBER   rather than   NUMBER   examples of unassertive behavior

MISC,previous studies of the availability heuristic using the paradigm of schwarz et al CITATION   have turned up impressive and robust results
MISC,however   these demonstrations have been restricted primarily to laboratory surveys in which task of recalling examples then making an overall assessment may seem somewhat artificial to participants and the responses of little consequence
MISC,more important   most participants in previous studies presumably had little prior experience with the particular likert scale that served as the dependent measure e g    most had never before rated their childhood or public transportation on a   NUMBER -point scale
MISC,hence   ratings of respondents may be especially susceptible to superficial cues - such as the accessibility of instances - when mapping their beliefs and attitudes onto an unfamiliar response scale
OWNX,the present investigation overcomes these limitations through a   field study   of students evaluating a course
MISC,first   evaluations are a normal facet of most university courses in which students are commonly asked to list specific suggestions and also provide a global assessment

MISC,"competition abounds in everyday life , where we contend with others for top grades , jobs , trophies , and mates"
MISC,"when resources are at a premium , it is optimal to enter into competitive environments in which we are certain to fare well and to avoid those in which we are doomed to fail"
MISC,"however , when people evaluate their likelihood of success in competitions , they are subject to a robust bias : a competitor should consider the strengths and weaknesses of the self and the other competitors   CITATION , but people often give too much weight to evidence related to their own strengths and weaknesses and too little weight to such evidence about the competitor   CITATION"
MISC,"this egocentrism results in overoptimism when the circumstances of the competition are favorable , such as when competitors in a trivia game learn that the questions will be from an easy category - even though they 'll be easy for everyone   CITATION"
MISC,"egocentrism also results in overpessimism when the circumstances are unfavorable e g , a difficult trivia category"
MISC,"this phenomenon of being more optimistic when shared competitive circumstances are favorable than when they are not has been dubbed the shared - circumstance effect   CITATION , and it has been replicated across a variety of settings e g , general knowledge tasks , card games , athletic competitions"
MISC,"in most previous studies on the sce , participants were presented with novel , non - repeated competitive situations"
MISC,these situations did not allow people to learn from past experiences or from feedback within the immediate competitive context
MISC,"however , in everyday contexts there are often opportunities to learn how a shared circumstance tends to affect the self , others , and outcomes"
MISC,"for example , when a tennis tournament is played during a string of windy days , players can have several opportunities to observe how the weather affects themselves and their competitors"
MISC,"to examine whether egocentrism and sces persist in repeated - play contexts , rose and windschitl   CITATION   had pairs of participants compete against each other in multiple rounds of a trivia contest that involved easy and hard categories"
MISC,"in each round , participants estimated their likelihood of beating their competitor , answered trivia questions , and received feedback about who won"
MISC,"in initial rounds , there were robust sces ; participants were much more optimistic about winning easy categories than hard ones"
MISC,"if they encountered the same hard and easy categories across rounds , the participants learned from feedback"
MISC,"that is , the sce shrank - but slowly - across six rounds with the same categories"
MISC,"the sce was never eliminated , even after six rounds"
MISC,"also , for a seventh round , participants were told there would be new categories"
MISC,the sce for that round dramatically and fully rebounded ; it was every bit as large as observed for round 1
MISC,these results provide a bleak view of how well people can learn from feedback and avoid sces
MISC,"moreover , results from a study by moore and cain   CITATION , which also used repeated plays with feedback , suggest an even bleaker view"
MISC,"those researchers also used easy and difficult quizzes as shared - circumstance manipulations , but found virtually no reduction in sces after numerous rounds with feedback"
MISC,CITATION are people 's abilities to learn to avoid sces - based on feedback - really as bleak as this prior research might suggest
AIMX,"we argue that some shared circumstances are more transparently shared than others , and this may affect how readily people learn to avoid the bias that creates sces - and how easily they can transfer this learning to a slightly new set of shared circumstances"
OWNX,"by transparently shared , we are referring to how obvious it is that a circumstance that is helpful or hindering to the self will affect others in largely the same way"
OWNX,"in the present study , we examined the influence of repeated feedback on sces"
CONT,"however , unlike past research , we used a competition in which the difficulty of the shared circumstance relative to competitions , for example , involving easy and hard trivia categories is more transparently shared"
OWNX,"in a multi - round paradigm , participants competed in object - tossing competitions"
OWNX,"in each round , two competitors each had 8 throws per object - attempting to land the object inside a target area"
OWNX,"there was always one easy - to - aim object e g , a beanbag and one hard - to - aim object e g , a paper plate , which constituted our shared - circumstance manipulation"
OWNX,"full feedback was given during and after each round , and predictions were solicited before each round and also before a final round with novel objects"
OWNX,"we suspected that a tossing competition , rather than a trivia competition , would produce less bleak results about the debiasing of sces through repeated play"
MISC,"in the case of trivia , watching one 's competitor fail to answer trivia questions does n't give any insight about why the category is difficult for that person"
MISC,"also , knowing that one 's competitor struggled on a difficult category does not provide obvious information about why he or she might struggle on another difficult category"
MISC,"however , in the case of throwing , watching a competitor fail when tossing an object probably illuminates the relevance of specific shared , situational circumstances i e , the properties of the specific objects as well as a more general awareness of the relevance that object properties have on throwing success - for anyone"
MISC,"for example , seeing a paper plate fly unpredictably will likely give an observer a clear impression that the object will fly unpredictably regardless of who is throwing it"
MISC,"for participants , this enhances the appreciation that one 's struggles are not primarily due to personal characteristics but to properties of the tossed objects ; this would then be useful in mitigating egocentrism and sces , even when new objects are introduced"
OWNX,"consequently , we expected that , even though participants might reveal a robust sce at round 1 prior to any feedback or observations regarding their competitor , they would show a pronounced learning effect after the feedback and observations of round 1"
OWNX,"that is , they would show significantly reduced sces starting immediately after round 1"
OWNX,we also expected that this learning would be generally transferable

 	 A new theoretical survey of proteins ' resistance to constant speed stretching is performed for a set of 17 134 proteins as described by a structure - based model ."
MISC,The proteins selected have no gaps in their structure determination and consist of no more than 250 amino acids .
MISC,Our previous studies have dealt with 7510 proteins of no more than 150 amino acids .
MISC,The proteins are ranked according to the strength of the resistance .
MISC,Most of the predicted top - strength proteins have not yet been studied experimentally .
MISC,Architectures and folds which are likely to yield large forces are identified .
MISC,New types of potent force clamps are discovered .
MISC,"They involve disulphide bridges and , in particular , cysteine slipknots ."
MISC,An effective energy parameter of the model is estimated by comparing the theoretical data on characteristic forces to the corresponding experimental values combined with an extrapolation of the theoretical data to the experimental pulling speeds .
MISC,These studies provide guidance for future experiments on single molecule manipulation and should lead to selection of proteins for applications .
MISC,"A new class of proteins , involving cystein slipknots , is identified as one that is expected to lead to the strongest force clamps known ."
MISC,"This class is characterized through molecular dynamics simulations . 
 # # # introduction # # #"
MISC,"Atomic force microscopy , optical tweezers , and other tools of nanotechnology have enabled induction and monitoring of large conformational changes in biomolecules ."
MISC,"Such studies are performed to assess structure of the biomolecules , their elastic properties , and ability to act as nanomachines in a cell ."
MISC,Stretching studies of proteins CITATION are of a particular current interest and they have been performed for under a hundred of systems .
MISC,"Interpretation of some of these experiments has been helped by all - atom simulations , such as reported in refs . CITATION , CITATION ."
CONT,They are limited by of order 100 ns time scales and thus require using unrealistically large constant pulling speeds .
MISC,"However , they often elucidate the nature of the force clamp the region responsible for the largest force of resistance to pulling , FORMULA ."
MISC,All of the experimental and all - atom simulational studies address merely a tiny fraction of proteins that are stored in the Protein Data Bank CITATION .
MISC,Thus it appears worthwhile to consider a large set of proteins and determine their FORMULA within an approximate model that allows for fast and yet reasonably accurate calculations .
MISC,"Structure - based models of proteins , as pioneered by Go and his collaborators CITATION and used in several implementations CITATION CITATION , seem to be suited to this task especially well since they are defined in terms of the native structures away from which stretching is imposed ."
MISC,"There are many ways , all phenomenological , to construct a structure - based model of a protein ."
MISC,504 of possible variants are enumerated and 62 are studied in details in ref . CITATION .
MISC,"The variants differ by the choice of effective potentials , nature of the local backbone stiffness , energy - related parameters , and of the coarse - grained degrees of freedom ."
MISC,The most crucial choice relates to making a decision about which interactions between amino acids count as native contacts .
MISC,Comparing FORMULA to the corresponding experimental values in 36 available cases selects several optimal models CITATION .
MISC,"Among them , there is one which is very simple and which describes a protein in terms of its FORMULA atoms , as labeled by the sequential index FORMULA ."
MISC,"This model is denoted by FORMULA which stands for , respectively , the Lennard - Jones native contact potentials , local backbone stiffness represented by harmonic terms that favor the native values of local chiralities , the contact map in which there are no FORMULA contacts , and the amplitude of the Lennard - Jones potential , FORMULA , is uniform ."
MISC,"The contact map is determined by assigning the van der Waals spheres to the heavy atoms and by checking whether spheres belonging to different amino acids overlap in the native state CITATION , CITATION ."
MISC,"If they do , a contact is declared as native ."
MISC,Non - native contacts are considered repulsive .
MISC,Application of this criterion frequently selects the FORMULA contacts as native .
MISC,If the contact map includes these contacts the resulting model will be denoted here as FORMULA .
MISC,"On average , it performs worse than FORMULA because the FORMULA contacts usually correspond to the weak van der Waals couplings as can be demonstrated in a sample of proteins by using a software CITATION which analyses atomic configurations from the chemical perspective on molecular bonds ."
MISC,Thus the FORMULA couplings should better be removed from the contact map .
MISC,"The survey to determine FORMULA in 7510 model proteins with the number of amino acids , FORMULA , not exceeding 150 and 239 longer proteins has been accomplished twice ."
MISC,First within the FORMULA model CITATION and soon afterwords within the FORMULA model CITATION .
MISC,The first survey also comes with many details of the methodology whereas the second just presents the outcomes .
MISC,"The two surveys are compared in more details in refs . CITATION , CITATION ."
MISC,"The results differ , particularly when it comes to ranking of the proteins according to the value of FORMULA , but they mutually provide the error bars on the findings ."
MISC,"They both agree , however , on predicting that there are many proteins whose strength should be considerably larger than the frequently studied benchmark the sarcomere protein titin ."
MISC,"Near the top of the list , there is the scaffoldin protein c7A which has been recently measured to have FORMULA of about 480 pN CITATION ."
MISC,"Other findings include establishing correlations with the CATH hierarchical classification scheme CITATION , CITATION , such as that there are no strong FORMULA proteins , and identification of several types of the force clamps ."
MISC,The large forces most commonly originate in parallel FORMULA that are sheared CITATION .
MISC,"However , there are also clamps with antiparallel FORMULA , unstructured strands , and other kinds ."
MISC,"The two surveys have been based on the structure download made on July 26 , 2005 when the PDB comprised 29 385 entries ."
MISC,"Many of them correspond to nucleic acids , complexes with nucleic acids and with other proteins , carbohydrates , or come with incomplete files and hence the much smaller number of proteins that could be used in the molecular dynamics studies ."
MISC,"Here , we present results of still another survey which is based on a download of December 18 , 2008 which contains 54 807 structure files and leads to 17 134 acceptable structures with FORMULA not exceeding 250 ."
MISC,These structures are then analyzed through simulations based on the FORMULA model .
MISC,The numerical code has been improved to allow for acceleration of calculations by a factor of 2 .
MISC,"The 190 structures with the top values of FORMULA in units of FORMULA are shown in Table 1 and Table S1 of the SI , together with the values of titin and ubiquitin to provide a scale ."
MISC,"As argued in the Materials and Methods section section , the unit of force , FORMULA , is now estimated to be of order 110 pN."
MISC,All of the corresponding proteins are predicted to be much stronger than titin and none but two of them have been studied experimentally yet .

OWNX,"We have hypothesized that a longer period of a highly suppressive induction therapy that is appropriately timed relative to the start of maintenance therapy may allow minority resistant variants to decay below a stochastic extinction threshold , allowing for successful long - term treatment with simpler and better - tolerated regimens ."

MISC,"Among the various constraints which were formulated we find , for example , keeping metabolic energy consumption as low as possible CITATION CITATION , or keeping total wiring length between processing units at a minimum CITATION , or maximizing the suppression of spatio - temporal redundancy in the input signal CITATION , CITATION CITATION ."
MISC,"As for visual stimuli , natural images reveal a conspicuous statistical regularity that comes as an approximately linear decrease of their amplitude spectra as a function of spatial frequency CITATION CITATION ."
MISC,"This means that pairs of luminance values are strongly correlated CITATION , and this property could be exploited for gain controlling of visual neurons ."
MISC,"Then , visual neurons would have equal sensitivities or response amplitudes independent of their spatial frequency preference CITATION ."
MISC,"According to this response equalization hypothesis , gain should thus be incremented with increasing spatial frequency , such that the distribution of response amplitudes of frequency - tuned neurons to a typical natural image is flat ."
MISC,"An argument in favor of employing response equalization is that it would lead to an improvement of information transmission from one neuronal stage to another , because the output of one stage would match the limited dynamic range of a second one CITATION ."
AIMX,"The present article builds upon previously reported results for whitened amplitude spectra of face images CITATION : the whitened spectra reveal a spatial frequency maximum at 10 15 cycles per face , but only if external face features are suppressed ."
BASE,"The predicted frequency maximum nevertheless agrees well with numerous psychophysical experiments , which found that face identity is preferably processed in a narrow band of spatial frequencies from 8 to 16 cycles per face CITATION CITATION ."
MISC,"Despite of it all , the results presented in CITATION indicate that the maxima in the amplitude spectra are caused by the compound effect of horizontally oriented internal face features ."
MISC,"Quantitatively , the maxima thus occur in units of cycles per face height , whereas most psychophysical studies instead measure their results in terms of cycles per face width ."
MISC,"Furthermore , although a clear enhancement of horizontal amplitudes could be observed in the spectra , horizontal amplitudes showed a somewhat noisy dependence on spatial frequency ."
MISC,"Both effects are a consequence of that face features were not considered individually , what causes a mixing of the spatial frequency content of individual face features in the spectra ."
MISC,"The mixing leads to averaging - out effects such that any possible enhancement of spectral amplitudes at other than the horizontal orientation goes unnoticed , but also may cause interference effects which lead to the mentioned noisy dependence of amplitudes on spatial frequency ."
OWNX,The present study addresses the two issues by means of an extensive analysis of face images by means of Gabor filters .
OWNX,"The filters were thereby parameterized to match the spatial receptive field of band - limited , oriented and contrast sensitive neurons in the primary visual cortex CITATION CITATION ."
OWNX,Great care has been taken to guarantee the correct alignment of filter responses with respect to the position of internal face features prior to their averaging .
OWNX,Doing so permits to precisely elucidate how the frequency dependence of Gabor responses is related to each of the four internal face features .
OWNX,The resulting graphs of whitened Gabor amplitudes versus spatial frequency are smooth and reveal distinct maxima at nearly all orientations .
OWNX,"The most stable maxima , however , are observed at horizontal feature orientations in the first place , but also at vertical orientations ."
OWNX,This observation holds true for all of the internal face features .
OWNX,"The present study therefore shows how the individual internal face features contribute to the psychophysically observed frequency preference , and proposes concrete mechanisms of how higher amplitudes of whitened cell responses at an early level could possibly lead to the psychophysically measured effects ."

 Numerous psychophysical experiments found that humans preferably rely on a narrow band of spatial frequencies for recognition of face identity ."
MISC,A recently conducted theoretical study by the author suggests that this frequency preference reflects an adaptation of the brain 's face processing machinery to this specific stimulus class .
AIMX,The purpose of the present study is to examine this property in greater detail and to specifically elucidate the implication of internal face features .
OWNX,"To this end , I parameterized Gabor filters to match the spatial receptive field of contrast sensitive neurons in the primary visual cortex ."
OWNX,"Filter responses to a large number of face images were computed , aligned for internal face features , and response - equalized ."
OWNX,The results demonstrate that the frequency preference is caused by internal face features .
OWNX,"Thus , the psychophysically observed human frequency bias for face processing seems to be specifically caused by the intrinsic spatial frequency content of internal face features .

 # # # introduction # # #"
MISC,Splicing is an essential process that constructs protein coding messenger RNA sequences using tiny segments of information buried in the much larger primary transcripts of the eukaryotic gene .
MISC,"Regulated alternative splicing can create different protein coding sequences under different biological circumstances , allowing the production of functionally related but distinct proteins ."
MISC,"In addition , alternative splicing can mediate the repression of gene expression by stimulating the formation of transcripts subject to nonsense - mediated decay CITATION CITATION ."
MISC,"Splicing patterns seem distinct in the vertebrate nervous system compared to other tissues CITATION , CITATION , and it is tempting to hypothesize that neural alternative splicing contributed to the rapid evolution of the vertebrate brain without large increases in gene number CITATION ."
MISC,"Biochemical analysis of alternative splicing has shown that numerous RNA binding proteins influence the use of specific splice sites to stimulate splicing events that lead to particular mRNA isoforms CITATION , CITATION ."
MISC,These RNA binding proteins may activate or repress the use of splice sites by binding to nearby sequences in the exon or in the intron .
MISC,"In many cases , multiple RNA binding proteins combine to create repressing and activating influences that produce patterns of splicing control CITATION , CITATION ."
MISC,"Some proteins , such as SR proteins and the CELF proteins , have mostly activating roles , whereas others , such as hnRNP A1 , PTB , and nPTB , have mostly repressing roles ."
MISC,"Certain proteins can either activate or repress splicing in different contexts , depending on the position of their binding sites or the expression of other RNA binding proteins CITATION , CITATION ."
MISC,A complete catalog of the RNA sequences corresponding to the enhancers and silencers bound by splicing regulatory proteins would greatly aid the understanding of splicing regulatory networks .
MISC,"Thus far , there are only a handful of splicing regulators whose corresponding RNA binding motifs have been identified , whereas there may be many splicing regulators among the hundreds of RNA binding proteins encoded by the mouse genome ."
MISC,"In addition , several related but distinct genes produce proteins that bind the same or overlapping sets of sequences ; for example , Fox-1 and RBM9 each bind UGCAUG CITATION , CITATION , and the branchpoint binding protein SF1 and the protein quaking each bind UACUAAC - like motifs CITATION CITATION ."
MISC,"Adding to this complexity is the tendency for the mRNAs of RNA binding proteins to be alternatively spliced , leading to multiple RNA binding protein isoforms with potentially different functions ."
CONT,"Currently , the methods available for expanding the list of known regulators and their target sequences are limited , and the development of this catalog is in the early stage CITATION ."
MISC,Much of the available genomic information on alternative splicing is derived by the alignment of large numbers of expressed sequence tags and messenger RNAs to genome sequences .
MISC,"The analysis of exons that appear to be constitutive or alternative has led to the successful identification of many distinguishing features of alternatively spliced regions CITATION CITATION , even allowing their accurate prediction without cDNA evidence CITATION , CITATION , CITATION ."
CONT,"Although cDNA libraries have been invaluable for discovering general features of alternatively spliced exons , it is difficult to connect specific regulatory sequences to specific biological conditions with confidence due to variable and sometimes missing information about the source materials and methods of cDNA library construction ."
CONT,The relatively low number of transcripts present from any one gene also makes it difficult to estimate differences in expression levels using library representation as a measure .
MISC,"Thus , more direct methods are needed to associate alternative splicing events with underlying biological conditions ."
MISC,The recent application of microarray technology to questions of splicing and splicing regulation promises to reveal parallel connections between many splicing events and specific biological or experimental conditions CITATION CITATION .
MISC,"Analysis of experimental changes in splicing for many genes simultaneously should reveal biological conditions necessary for proper splicing regulation in a way that analysis of cDNA libraries can not , and with breadth that can not be achieved by analysis of a reporter construct or a few endogenous target genes ."
OWNX,"To demonstrate this , we constructed a DNA microarray designed to capture splicing information for about 6,200 alternative events in the mouse transcriptome , using a combination of splice junction and exon probes , and have hybridized RNA from 22 adult mouse tissues ."
AIMX,We examine splicing in these tissues by asking three questions .
OWNX,"First we ask , Which RNA isoforms are present in a particular tissue sample ?"
OWNX,"To answer this simple question , we used a new method based on comparing the intensity of the probes in a probe set to the distribution of intensities from all probes with similar G C level ."
BASE,"This is similar in spirit although different in approach to the present - absent calls from Affymetrix MAS 5.0 algorithms CITATION , as this microarray did not contain mismatch probes ."
OWNX,"Using RT - PCR , we show that this method has a true - positive rate of 85 percent ."
OWNX,"Second we ask , Which RNA isoforms are differentially expressed across the tissues examined ?"
BASE,"For each RNA isoform , the intensities of the isoform - specific junction probes were examined across tissues using the Kruskal - Wallis statistical test ."
OWNX,"After correcting for multiple testing , about 40 percent of the 6,216 total alternative splicing events examined were found to have more than one RNA form that was differentially expressed , indicating widespread tissue differences in splicing over the tissues ."
OWNX,"Third we ask , Which cassette exons are included differentially between brain and nonbrain tissues ?"
OWNX,"To answer this , we used a regression - based bootstrapping method , which also allows an estimate of the relative change in skipping and inclusion in the two sample groups ."
OWNX,We analyzed the intron sequences associated with exon skipping events that are differentially regulated in brain or muscle relative to other tissues and found unusual patterns of sequence conservation that provide new information about tissue regulation of alternative splicing and its evolution .
